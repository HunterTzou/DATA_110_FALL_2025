Something we need to learn about is **Emphasis** in *Markdown*. You can emphasize things using **bold** or *italics* 

In Markdown, somtimes you need to make lists...

**Here is a *bullet point* list:**
- bullet 1
- bullet 2
  - Nested Bullet

**Here is a *numbered* list:**
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   1. Nested Item

Sometimes you want to embed a [link](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2FQiDOnTCqOhVDnYqpDhUG2zzo08I3jbAjoBUv0g5zFM8.gif%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3Da0cdb6e57ae65296d3499b7ca053fe4ae196c7ab)

## **Blockquotes**

> “Ask not what you can do for your country, but what your country can do for you”  
> *— Bob Dylan*

Blockquotes are cool if you want to sound smart.

## **Inline Code & Code Blocks**

Inline code looks like this: `print("hello world")`  

Use it when you want to flex that you have the ability to write words and probably mispell them.

Full code blocks are good when you want it to look like you *definitely* know what you’re doing:

```python
import random

quotes = [
    "Sleep is for the weak",
    "Don't push to main",
    "Works on my machine"
]

print(random.choice(quotes))

```
## **Tables**

Making tables in Markdown is really annoying. Just use this [website](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to do it for you. 

Here is a table I made using it:

|    **Undesirable Task**   | **Dislike Rating (1-10)** |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|           Dishes          |             5             |
|         Organizing        |             7             |

## **Task Lists**

**Here’s a very real and serious to-do list:**

- [x] Add my dog to the README
- [x] Nap
- [ ] Finish this assignment


## **Footnotes**

Sometimes you need to put links for things called *footnotes*. They're just a way for people to go to places that you reference [^1]

[^1]: Wow! You can click a link! Good job!! Here's a cookie! <img width="500" height="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0920432-92a4-476e-8084-34ce50ece65b" />
