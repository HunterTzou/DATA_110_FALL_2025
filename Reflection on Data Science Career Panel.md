# Reflection on Data Science Career Panel



## Questions



1. **Takeaways:** What is one important idea, skill, or piece of advice you learned from the panel?

* You can pivot from any space and it is about finding the transferrable skills from where you are and your experience to where you want to go. Then you can fill in the gaps with new skills.



2. **Reflection:** How does this connect to your own career goals or interests in data science?

* This was both motivating and daunting since these individuals came from diverse backgrounds, yet they also possess considerable experience and education. I believe the takeaway is to use what you already have—whether past experience or current strengths—and build on that to reach your goals. Maintaining a positive attitude and being consistent are essential for achieving success.



3. **Question:** If you had the chance, what is one question you would ask the panelists?

* How can companies ensure they do not unintentionally cause harm with AI tools, given the wide range of applications that sometimes involve human intervention? Will there always be a need for some degree of HI (Human Intelligence)? (For example, a resume ranking system that unintentionally discriminates against certain applicants)
* How important is domain knowledge? As someone who is newer to the data space/job market, I am not exactly sure what area I am interested in and it can be difficult to choose what portfolio projects I should create to show my abilities.
* Is it necessary to be familiar with all the various languages, systems, and so on, or is the focus more on having a solid knowledge base and developing problem-solving skills? Is it acceptable to assert experience in a specific language based on your quick learning ability and confidence, even if your actual experience is minimal, especially given how competitive the market is?
