## Reflection

Visiting the museum—especially the C-level galleries—was a powerful and sobering experience. Moving chronologically from the 1400s through modern American history provided a deeper understanding of how African American stories, contributions, and struggles shaped the foundation of the United States. Much of the material was emotionally heavy, particularly the sections on slavery, resistance, and Reconstruction, and the pacing of the exhibition forced me to sit with moments of discomfort rather than pass by them.

Although we had to leave earlier than planned, the portion we experienced was enough to leave a lasting impression. The timeline walls, maps, and pictorial displays made history feel immediate and tangible. I left with a strong desire to return, not only to finish the historical floors but to explore the cultural and artistic exhibits we did not reach. There is so much depth across the museum that one visit cannot fully capture it.
