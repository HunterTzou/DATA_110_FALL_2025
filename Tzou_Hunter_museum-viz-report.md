# Real Data Visualization Examples: National Museum of African American History and Culture

### Group Members: Hunter Tzou

### Date of visit: 11/30/2025

## Reflection

Visiting the museum—especially the C-level galleries—was a powerful and sobering experience. Moving chronologically from the 1400s through modern American history provided a deeper understanding of how African American stories, contributions, and struggles shaped the foundation of the United States. Much of the material was emotionally heavy, particularly the sections on slavery, resistance, and Reconstruction, and the pacing of the exhibition forced me to sit with moments of discomfort rather than pass by them.

Although we had to leave earlier than planned, the portion we experienced was enough to leave a lasting impression. The timeline walls, maps, and pictorial displays made history feel immediate and tangible. I left with a strong desire to return, not only to finish the historical floors but to explore the cultural and artistic exhibits we did not reach. There is so much depth across the museum that one visit cannot fully capture it.

## Visualization Analysis

### 1. “The Chesapeake – Making Race” Panel

<img width="2626" height="1978" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e417619-44e7-4d1d-b553-83bf4af49660" />

**Chart Type:**  
Annotated map + historical timeline

**Main Question It Answers:**  
How race, slavery, and class distinctions developed in the Chesapeake region, and how laws, migration, and economic changes shaped racial hierarchy from the 1600s through the early 1700s.

**Data Shown (Variables, Units, Timeframe):**
- Geographic regions of early colonial America (especially the Chesapeake).
- Key events such as arrival of English settlers, arrival of enslaved Africans, development of tobacco exports, and changes in slave codes.
- Timeframe roughly from 1607 to early 1700s.
- Categorical information about legal status (indentured, enslaved, “for life”) and race.

**Marks & Channels Used:**
- **Position (map):** Colonies and regions located along the U.S. East Coast.
- **Lines/borders:** Coastlines and colony boundaries.
- **Text blocks:** Events and descriptions aligned vertically as a timeline.
- **Color (mostly grayscale):** Subtle differences between land, water, and highlighted regions.
- **Typography / weight:** Larger fonts for title and section labels; smaller fonts for detailed events.

**Design Choices (Scales, Labels, Legends, Annotations):**
- Minimal color palette to keep attention on the narrative text and historical quotes.
- Clear title (“The Chesapeake – Making Race”) and explanatory paragraph that frames the visualization.
- Chronological list of events with years emphasized, functioning as a timeline.
- Virginia Slave Code quote at the top to anchor the visualization in a specific law and date.

**Potential Misleaders (Axes, Colors, Aspect Ratio, etc.):**
- Because the timeline is purely textual, spacing between events might imply equal time gaps even when decades differ.
- The grayscale color scheme can make geographic differences harder to see at a glance.
- The map is not scaled to show data density (e.g., number of enslaved people per colony), so visual area may suggest equal importance across regions even if historical numbers differed.

**One Suggested Improvement:**
Add small visual markers or color highlights linking each timeline event to locations on the map, and include a separate heatmap of West and Central Africa showing approximate regions of origin and numbers of people taken. This would help connect the legal and social changes in the Chesapeake with the African communities that were directly affected.

### 2. Revolutionary War Timeline

<img width="2626" height="1978" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc01a4bf-88c4-4802-af8a-3672ec48c03b" />

**Chart Type:**  
Horizontal timeline with annotated illustrations and descriptive text

**Main Question It Answers:**  
How African Americans—both enslaved and free—contributed to the American Revolution, and how their participation shaped ideas of liberty, freedom, and the early formation of the United States.

**Data Shown (Variables, Units, Timeframe):**
- Key dates and events during the Revolutionary era (mid-1700s to late 1700s)
- Roles of Black soldiers, sailors, laborers, and supporters
- Descriptions of individual actions (e.g., fighting for both British and American forces)
- Contextual information about promises of freedom, military service, and the broader struggle against slavery

**Marks & Channels Used:**
- **Position (horizontal):** Events arranged left-to-right along a timeline
- **Images/illustrations:** Visual marks highlighting major themes or stories
- **Color blocks:** Distinguish different event sections or highlight notable individuals
- **Text placement:** Blocks aligned with date markers to show sequence
- **Typography:** Larger titles (“The American Revolution”), smaller descriptive captions

**Design Choices (Scales, Labels, Legends, Annotations):**
- Use of period artwork to anchor viewers emotionally in the era
- Highlighted date markers (e.g., 1775) to break the timeline into recognizable milestones
- Consistent layout of image → date → explanation to maintain easy readability
- Strong contrast between dark background and white/yellow text to ensure clarity
- Integration of quotes and expanded captions to contextualize individual stories

**Potential Misleaders (Axes, Colors, Aspect Ratio, etc.):**
- Uneven spacing between dates may imply equal time intervals when the actual gaps vary
- The heavy use of artwork and imagery might draw attention away from chronological details
- Without numbers or proportions, the timeline conveys **narrative impact** but not **scale**—for example, how many Black soldiers served or how participation differed by region

**One Suggested Improvement:**
Include a small quantitative visualization—such as a bar or icon chart—showing estimated numbers of Black participants on each side (Patriot vs. British) or changes in enlistment over time. This would strengthen the viewer’s ability to understand not just the stories but the scale of African American involvement in the Revolutionary War.

### 3. Revolutionary War Pictograph – Black Population and Military Participation (Before, During, and After the War)

<img width="2626" height="1978" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7af6b60b-2ca8-4bb9-a020-5fca7a130e7c" />

**Chart Type:**  
Pictograph (icon-based chart) with grouped categories and counts

**Main Question It Answers:**  
How many African Americans lived in colonial North America before the Revolutionary War, how many fought on each side during the conflict, and what the population looked like after the war—highlighting how freedom and enslavement changed (or did not change) after independence.

---

#### **Data Shown (Variables, Units, Timeframe):**
- **Variables & Counts:**  
  - *Before the War (1770)*  
    - Black population: **459,822**  
  - *Fighting the War*  
    - Blacks who fought as Patriots: **5,000–6,000**  
    - Blacks who fought as Loyalists: **20,000**  
  - *After the War*  
    - Enslaved African Americans: **697,897**  
    - Free African Americans: **59,466**  
    - Approximately **10,000 Loyalists relocated**  
- **Units:** Number of individuals  
- **Timeframe:** Pre‐Revolution (1770), wartime (1775–1783), and post‐war period (1780s)

---

#### **Marks & Channels Used:**
- **Icons (small human figures):** Represent units of population  
- **Repetition:** More icons = larger population  
- **Position:** Three grouped sections (Before / Fighting / After) to reinforce chronological order  
- **Color:** Gold/yellow icons for all categories to maintain visual consistency  
- **Text labels:** Numeric counts reinforce what each icon set represents

---

#### **Design Choices (Scales, Labels, Legends, Annotations):**
- Icons are arranged in horizontal rows to create immediate visual comparisons  
- Subtitles clearly separate timeline phases  
- Numeric values included to prevent misinterpretation of icon magnitude  
- The accompanying artwork next to the panel deepens historical context but does not alter the data visualization  
- Minimalist background ensures icons remain visually dominant

---

#### **Potential Misleaders (Axes, Colors, Aspect Ratio, etc.):**
- **Lack of a clear icon-to-people ratio:** Icons seem symbolic rather than proportional—e.g., 459,822 is not literally represented at scale  
- **Equal icon size for vastly different counts** may downplay differences (e.g., comparing 6,000 Patriots to nearly 700,000 enslaved people)  
- **Color uniformity:** Same icon color across categories may make it hard to differentiate outcomes (enslaved vs. free) at a glance  
- Loose ranges (“5,000–6,000 Patriots”) challenge precise interpretation  

---

#### **One Suggested Improvement:**
Include a legend specifying how many individuals each icon represents (e.g., 1 icon = 10,000 people). Alternatively, use different colored icons for “Patriot,” “Loyalist,” “Enslaved,” and “Free” statuses to allow clearer categorical comparison without relying solely on numeric labels.

---

#### **Historical Insight (Optional):**
The pictograph reveals a complex reality: despite African Americans fighting on **both sides** of the Revolutionary War, the postwar population still included nearly **700,000 enslaved people**, dwarfing the number who gained freedom. This visualization underscores the limited impact of independence on freedom for most African Americans and highlights the conflicting promises made by both Patriot and Loyalist forces.

[1950 Map](https://www.searchablemuseum.com/challenging-segregation-in-the-courts/)


**Chart Type:**  
Paired choropleth maps (color‐encoded percentage by state)

**Main Question They Answer:**  
How the geographic distribution of African Americans changed from the first post–Civil War census in 1870 to the mid‐20th century in 1950, revealing long-term demographic patterns and the effects of Reconstruction, Jim Crow, and early stages of the Great Migration.

---

#### **Data Shown (Variables, Units, Timeframe):**
- **Variable:** Percentage of each state’s population that was African American  
- **Unit:** Percent (%)  
- **Timeframes:**  
  - **1870 Census** – first after emancipation  
  - **1950 Census** – post–World War II, during the Great Migration  
- **Geographic Scope:** All U.S. states and territories included in each census  
- **Data Type:** Quantitative, continuous percentage values grouped into color ranges

---

#### **Marks & Channels Used:**
- **Area (state polygons):** Represents geographic units  
- **Color hue/saturation:** Encodes percentage (light yellow for <2%, deep purple for >50%)  
- **Position:** Spatial map layout of the United States  
- **Shared legend:** Both maps use the **same gradient scale**, enabling direct comparison  

---

#### **Design Choices (Scales, Labels, Legends, Annotations):**
- A **consistent color scale** across both maps makes visual comparisons meaningful  
- The gradient highlights regional concentration, especially deep purples in the Southeast  
- A neutral background increases contrast between states  
- Titles clearly differentiate the two years while maintaining similar formatting  
- Simple, minimalistic maps avoid distractions and emphasize color‐encoded differences  

---

#### **Potential Misleaders (Axes, Colors, Aspect Ratio, etc.):**
- **Choropleth maps visually weight larger states more heavily**, even if their population was relatively small  
- **Equal area does not equal equal population**, so states like Wyoming or Montana can seem more “present” than densely populated northern states  
- **Color bands around the 2–10% range are subtle**, making smaller variations less noticeable  
- Missing or grayed-out territories may be misinterpreted as 0% rather than “data unavailable”

---

#### **One Suggested Improvement:**
Include a small inset chart or map series showing actual **population counts** or **migration flows** between 1870 and 1950. This would better reveal the magnitude of the Great Migration—where millions of African Americans moved from the rural South to northern and midwestern cities—beyond the percentage changes shown on the maps.

---

#### **Historical Insight (Optional Narrative Connection):**
Together, these maps provide a striking visualization of how African American population patterns evolved:
- **In 1870**, the population remained overwhelmingly concentrated in the South, especially in former slaveholding states.  
- **By 1950**, although the South still had the highest percentages, more states outside the region show increased numbers due to early migration movements.

The paired maps work as a powerful story of demographic change, resilience, and the long-term consequences of enslavement, emancipation, and migration.

### 5. W.E.B. Du Bois – “Number of Negro Students Taking Various Courses of Study in Georgia Schools”

<img width="818" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8f67017-0876-420b-8ccd-a8dc548828dd" />

**Chart Type:**  
Bar chart (innovative hand-drawn form using curved and elongated bars)

**Main Question It Answers:**  
What fields of study Black students in Georgia were enrolled in, and how enrollment differed across academic and vocational tracks.

---

#### **Data Shown (Variables, Units, Timeframe):**
- **Variables:**  
  - Number of Black students studying Business (12)  
  - Classical studies (98)  
  - Professional studies (152)  
  - Scientific studies (161)  
  - Normal/teacher training (838)  
  - Industrial training (2252)
- **Units:** Count of students  
- **Timeframe:** Late 19th–early 20th century (Du Bois’s Atlanta University studies, roughly 1890s–1900s)  
- **Geography:** Georgia, United States

---

#### **Marks & Channels Used:**
- **Length:** The primary quantitative channel—longer bars = more students  
- **Shape:** Curved, stylized bars (particularly the extremely long U-shaped industrial bar)  
- **Position:** Categories arranged vertically for comparison  
- **Color/Fill:** Uniform shading used for all bars, consistent with Du Bois’s aesthetic style  
- **Text labels:** Counts printed directly beside each category

---

#### **Design Choices (Scales, Labels, Legends, Annotations):**
- Hand-drawn aesthetic reflects Du Bois’s signature approach of blending data with artistic visualization  
- Absence of a typical axis reinforces the visual emphasis on bar length  
- Ordering of categories seems intentional: academic subjects first, vocational/industrial last  
- Extreme elongation of the industrial bar visually dramatizes its dominance  
- Clean background to avoid distraction from the geometric shapes

---

#### **Potential Misleaders (Axes, Colors, Aspect Ratio, etc.):**
- **No numerical axis** makes it harder to verify proportional accuracy  
- **U-shaped industrial bar** exaggerates length visually, because curvature adds surface area not directly tied to the data  
- Bars may not be to exact proportional scale due to hand-drawn construction  
- Uniform color means viewers rely entirely on length, which can be influenced by the page layout

---

#### **One Suggested Improvement:**
Add a straightforward linear scale or gridline reference—or at least mark a few benchmark values—to help viewers interpret the bar lengths more precisely. Keeping the artistic style while adding subtle quantitative anchors would make the graphic both expressive and accurate.

---

#### **Historical Insight (Optional):**
This graphic is part of Du Bois’s pioneering data visualization work for the 1900 Paris Exposition. It illustrates how industrial and vocational training overwhelmingly dominated the educational options available to African Americans in Georgia. The visual form, with its dramatic elongated curve, is not just informative but a deliberate commentary on the limited opportunities imposed by racial and economic systems of the era.
