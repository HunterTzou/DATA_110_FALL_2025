# Real Data Visualization Examples: National Museum of African American History and Culture

### Group Members: Hunter Tzou

## Reflection

Visiting the museum—especially the C-level galleries—was a powerful and sobering experience. Moving chronologically from the 1400s through modern American history provided a deeper understanding of how African American stories, contributions, and struggles shaped the foundation of the United States. Much of the material was emotionally heavy, particularly the sections on slavery, resistance, and Reconstruction, and the pacing of the exhibition forced me to sit with moments of discomfort rather than pass by them.

Although we had to leave earlier than planned, the portion we experienced was enough to leave a lasting impression. The timeline walls, maps, and pictorial displays made history feel immediate and tangible. I left with a strong desire to return, not only to finish the historical floors but to explore the cultural and artistic exhibits we did not reach. There is so much depth across the museum that one visit cannot fully capture it.

## Visualization Analysis

### 1. “The Chesapeake – Making Race” Panel

**Chart Type:**  
Annotated map + historical timeline

**Main Question It Answers:**  
How race, slavery, and class distinctions developed in the Chesapeake region, and how laws, migration, and economic changes shaped racial hierarchy from the 1600s through the early 1700s.

**Data Shown (Variables, Units, Timeframe):**
- Geographic regions of early colonial America (especially the Chesapeake).
- Key events such as arrival of English settlers, arrival of enslaved Africans, development of tobacco exports, and changes in slave codes.
- Timeframe roughly from 1607 to early 1700s.
- Categorical information about legal status (indentured, enslaved, “for life”) and race.

**Marks & Channels Used:**
- **Position (map):** Colonies and regions located along the U.S. East Coast.
- **Lines/borders:** Coastlines and colony boundaries.
- **Text blocks:** Events and descriptions aligned vertically as a timeline.
- **Color (mostly grayscale):** Subtle differences between land, water, and highlighted regions.
- **Typography / weight:** Larger fonts for title and section labels; smaller fonts for detailed events.

**Design Choices (Scales, Labels, Legends, Annotations):**
- Minimal color palette to keep attention on the narrative text and historical quotes.
- Clear title (“The Chesapeake – Making Race”) and explanatory paragraph that frames the visualization.
- Chronological list of events with years emphasized, functioning as a timeline.
- Virginia Slave Code quote at the top to anchor the visualization in a specific law and date.

**Potential Misleaders (Axes, Colors, Aspect Ratio, etc.):**
- Because the timeline is purely textual, spacing between events might imply equal time gaps even when decades differ.
- The grayscale color scheme can make geographic differences harder to see at a glance.
- The map is not scaled to show data density (e.g., number of enslaved people per colony), so visual area may suggest equal importance across regions even if historical numbers differed.

**One Suggested Improvement:**
Add small visual markers or color highlights linking each timeline event to locations on the map, and include a separate heatmap of West and Central Africa showing approximate regions of origin and numbers of people taken. This would help connect the legal and social changes in the Chesapeake with the African communities that were directly affected.
